# Description: 
- This is an interactive 3d project that allows users to navigate, explore, and learn the anatomy of an animal cell. The user is able to pinpoint a particular area of the cell and learn how an individual component works. This project was developed in JavaScript with the help of Three.js, HTML, CSS, and Vectary.

# Goal:
-	Create a 3d interactive human cell that displays its anatomy.

# Resources:
-	Three.js library
-	Dat.gui library
-	jQuery library
-	Html and CSS
-	WebGL shaders
-	Vectary (Used for the creation of custom shapes)

# Obstacles: 
-	Some of the obstacles were the creation of custom shapes for the main cell. Even with the software Vectary some shapes took a while to create.

# Data Structures and algorithms: 
-	The use of the ray-caster algorithm from three.js to selected specific objects on the cell.

# How to run:
-	Clone the repo
- cd into 3d-Cell-Model
- npm install
- npm start
