Goal:
-	Create a 3d interactive human cell that displays its anatomy.

What you want to demonstrate: 
-	I want to show the structure of a human cell using different tools that we have learned through the course.

Resources:
-	Three.js library
-	Dat.gui library
-	jQuery library
-	Html and CSS
-	WebGL shaders
-	Vectary (Used for the creation of custom shapes)

Obstacles: 
-	Some of the obstacles where the creation of custom shapes. Even with the software Vectary some shapes took a while to create.

Data Structures and algorithms: 
-	The only data structure used were arrays.
-	The use of the built-in ray-caster algorithm from three.js to selected specific objects on the cell.

Future additions: 
-	Add a plant cell and show how animal and plant cell differ from each other.

How to run:
-	The program just needs be open with a local server.
